= Learning Rama: Day 1

== Introduction

I want to learn the amazing programming platform Rama by trying to apply it to a problem I know well: Ardoq. Ardoq is a SaaS tool for enterprise architects and others, to map and model the resources, processes, assets, and strategy in an organization. The heart of Ardoq is a property multi-graph: a directed graph with multiple directed edges between nodes, and with an arbitrary bag of properties attached to nodes and edges.

There is of course no way to rewrite Ardoq in Rama in one person in a few days. Instead, I want to explore two things: (1) How can I model, store, and manage our core data in Rama instead of a relational database? (2) How does Rama make a few selected features simpler/harder to write?
